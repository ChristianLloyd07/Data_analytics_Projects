## ✅ Recommendations
- **Optimize Margins in High-Revenue Countries**
-  Focus on Germany and France to reduce operational costs and improve margin efficiency. Benchmark against Spain and Austria’s higher margin strategies.

 - **Store-Level Interventions**
     - Audit underperforming stores (Vienna #115, Seville #040, Poznań #068) to identify root causes (location, inventory, staffing). - Consider consolidation or targeted marketing to boost performance.
  - **Product Strategy**
     - Expand **Wellness and OTC** categories, which show strong profitability relative to revenue. - Maintain branded product dominance but explore cost-effective generic strategies to capture price-sensitive markets.
 - **Portfolio Management**
   - Target the “stable core” products (150K–350K revenue) for efficiency improvements in supply chain and marketing. - Invest in top-performing products (AntiBioX, GlucoSafe, NeuroMed) to sustain growth momentum.
    - **Pharmacy Type Focus**
    -  Urban pharmacies outperform rural and suburban locations. Allocate resources and promotions to urban stores while exploring tailored strategies for rural markets.
